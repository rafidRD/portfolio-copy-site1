## Three-axe

`Collect, summarize and share` I think these are the "three axes" of knowledge learning

Collect, easy to understand, such as collecting various learning resources, papers, articles that have been read, and various tools

Induction, or summary and classification, records the experiences and experiences in the learning process, writes various notes and articles, and organizes and categorizes the collected resources.

Sharing, whether it is uploading an article on a blog, or helping friends solve a problem in a QQ group, it is all sharing.

Without the ability to collect and summarize, the entire learning process is like using a vegetable basket to catch water and cannot be retained. Similarly, if you are unwilling to share, it is like working behind closed doors, unable to access different viewpoints, and no one will correct you. problems, over time, the ideas may become paranoid and self-contained

## Reading suggestions

`All documents in this project are written in the VScode editor, so they are only compatible with the markdown syntax previewed on the side of VScode, and are not compatible with the md syntax of other editors.`

~~Due to the fact that github's markdown engine kramdown does not support [TOC] links and various incompatible typesetting issues, the reading experience is extremely unfriendly. Therefore~~ it is recommended to download/clone it for local reading.
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ffffffff0x/1earn.git
```

Recommended reading experience
* [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) (Recommended, the entire project is written in the vscode environment, and there will be basically no typesetting problems )
* [Typora](https://www.typora.io/)

> If the clone speed is too slow, you can first import it into the code cloud (choose to import from the URL), and then clone: https://blog.gitee.com/2018/06/05/github_to_gitee/?from=homepage

> To improve release speed, you can refer to these articles https://jinfeijie.cn/post-805.html and https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_44821644/article/details/107574297?utm_source=app

> Now just press the period (.) key to enable the web version of vscode to browse this project
